# Castles & Quests

This is a collection of some castle & quests for LPMuds

If not oherwise stated with the corresponding castle/quest, look for 
README and LICENSE within the corresponding subdirs, all these files
are public domain...

Should you use any of these castles/quests you should appreciate the
hard work done by the original programmer and by those who ported the
original code to some other mudlib by mentioning them inside your mud
and, if possible, by sending them a note stating where you use their
code.

Layout of this repository:

The master branch contains the original code of each castle or quest.
regardless of it's origin and of any bug fixes or lack thereof...

Other branches are specific for one or another mudlib or even specific
to one single mud.

If the branch name starts with 'devel_' don't expect the contained code
to work properly or at all...
These branches are for development work (read for porting to the
specified mudlib/mud) only...

If your prefered mudlib or mud is missing, feel free to fork this
repository and start porting.

But if you do so:
Please use a mud specific branch only for those mud's which derivate
to much from the original base mudlib for ports to this lib to work anymore!
