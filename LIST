Padrone's and Quantos' castles have been certified to work under the LPmud
3.0 parser. Note! Only the 3.0 parser, but the old (2.4.5) mudlib.
All other might work but then again they might not work...

angmar 			Angmar's treasury

kantele			The well-known Kantele's mansion, somewhat
				debugged. There are probably lots of bugs
				left. Not for the faint at heart.

morgar			Morgar's tower
padrone			The famous walking castle of Padrone
				export version 1.0.5

*** Note: DesertWorld is currently unavailable ***
quantos			The DesertWorld of Quantos Tanthalon,
				originally from Avalon. Updated to 2.4.5/3.0
				and lots of fixes. Contains a 270-room maze.
