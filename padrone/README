Hi.

This is Padrone writing this, and this file ("README") contains a
short description of my castle. The first part is a description of
the areas that I have built, and the second describes the files
that implement it (i. e. the contents of this directory).
There is also a section called "Installing the export version".

This castle is currently present on NannyMud and, in the "export"
version, on a number of other LPmuds.
It used to be on Genesis too, but they're running an entirely different
version of the game now, a version with which this castle is not compatible.

The difference between the Nanny version and the export version
is just in the #defines in "players/padrone/config.h".


Compatibility
-------------

This version is supposed to work with a standard 2.4.5 mudlib,
and I have tested it both with the old 2.4.5 game driver and with
the new 3.0 game driver (in compatibility mode).


Copyright
---------

I didn't think this would be necessary, but here are the rules.

Copy it, edit it, do anything you want with it, BUT:
* Don't sell it. Don't try to make money from it.
  (However, if you give that money to me, we might discuss it...)
* Don't claim you wrote it.
* If you make any changes, then say so in the code.
  Don't re-distribute changed code without explicitly
  stating that it is not the original version.
  Change the version number by adding something, not just incrementing.
* Don't re-name it. It is the Castle of Padrone.


Where to get it from
--------------------

You can get an "official" version of the Castle of Padrone by
anonymouys ftp from ftp.lysator.liu.se (130.236.254.1).


The areas
---------

I have a (stationary) castle in the forest west of the village.
The entrance is supposed to be in /room/forest6.
There are around 20 outdoor rooms, and maybe 50 rooms inside.
Some notable monsters in this area:
Sir Obliterator, the anti-paladin (looking for someone called Violens)
The Wizard's apprentice (offers magic assistance to players)
A giant stainless steel dragon (guarding the treasury in the tower)
Rambo I, II, and III (also guarding the treasury)
The Sheriff (offers rewards for killed criminals)

There is also a walking castle that moves around, either randomly
or driven by a player. It starts in /room/plane2.
This walking castle contains 18 rooms, lots of pirates,
and, behind two locked doors, a big bad demon.

I have made a "shop" - actually just a front for the secret police.
This shop should not be located in my castle in the forest, but
somewhere in the (a) village.

There is a (small) quest and a (bigger) adventure in my castle.
The quest is to find the walking castle, kill a few (puny) pirates,
and bring it back to "me" (look at the file "quest.doc").
The adventure is more complicated, and involves more fighting
- go to the secret police shop and find out more about it
(or read the file "chaosdemon.doc").
If you #define CHAOSDEMON_QUEST in "config.h", the chaosdemon
adventure will also be a quest.

I also have a deposit box service. On NannyMud, it is in
the Lane of Ingis (move south-south-west from the church).

And then there is the mirror-maze. From magic mirrors that can be put
everywhere throughout the LPmud world, players can enter this maze,
and use it as a short-cut from one place to another.
Or, maybe more likely, they can use it to get lost and starve to death...

On NannyMud only, there is an "error" in one of my rooms. This error
will cause the player to fall out of the game, and end up in the room
where Nanny (the computer) is.


The files
---------

The file "config.h" on my player dir is used for the configuration
of my castle, either for NANNY or for GENESIS,
and (though I don't actually support this yet) for EXPORT.

If there is a file named "MESSAGE" on this directory, it contains
a short message on what I am currently doing, like if I am on a
vacation or if I have joined the Foregin Legion.
That file can also be read by reading the note in the
entry room to my castle ("/players/padrone/inside/gate_room"),
and in my workroom.

The rooms and locations in my (stationary) castle are primarily in
the three directories "outside", "inside" and "tower".

"outside" are the locations in the forest, like the front yard
and the room ("Open place") where my quest is solved.
Exceptions: "garbage_heap" and "vdb1" are on my main dir,
since other wizard's castles are connected to these rooms.

"inside" contains the rooms inside the castle (the stationary one),
except the ones in the tower.

"tower" contains the rooms in the tower.
The workroom, however, which is supposed to be in the tower,
is in "/players/padrone/workroom", for obvious reasons.
The same goes for the store room, "/players/padrone/store".

The subdirectory "obj" contains some objects, like the Wizards' hat,
the machine gun etc. Note that some objects may be in other
subdirectories, if I thought that that would be more natural
(like, for example, the membership for the Secret Police, which
is in the "secret_police" directory).

"wiz" contains some useful objects for use only by wizards.

"maze" contains the mirror maze, including the room
"/players/padrone/maze/load_mirrors.c", from which the magic 
mirrors are placed in their different locations.

In "dungeon" I have put the files for the "dig-it-yourself" dungeon
under the castle.

In "secret_police" there are the files for the secret police - the
rooms in the shop, the membership and the orders.

On NannyMud only, "lith" contains some rooms you can get to
by "falling out of the game", i. e. the Lysator clubroom.

On NannyMud only, "deposit" contains the files for the
deposit box service. Note that the most important room,
the boxroom, has to be in "/room" for save_object to work!

"walker" contains the rooms and objects for the walking castle.
This is the new, bug-free version, that is also used as an
export version - just change the "walker/walker.h" file.


Some considerations
-------------------

The wizard's hat (in players/padrone/obj/wizardshat.c)
can be used to teleport to any location that the player
has previously visited, but it does check realm() in the
same way as the amulet in Morgar's tower (another castle).


Installing the export version
-----------------------------

If you have the export version of my castle, here is how to install it:

1. Create a character called "Padrone", or banish that name.
   You DON'T want anyone to login as Padrone, except me (or you),
   since Padrone might have some special abilities in his own areas.

2. Put all the files and subdirectories in the dir "/players/padrone"
   (or rather, since you'll be doing this from Unix,
    "...../mudlib/players/padrone").
   Check that the LPmud process has the appropriate (read and write)
   permissions on all files and directories.

3. If you don't want to put the stationary castle in "/room/forest6",
   change the #define of DEST in "/players/padrone/castle.c".

4. If you changed the DEST, or if it doesn't match the terrain for some
   other reason: change the map in my "/players/padrone/obj/ticket.c"!

5. Find a place to put the secret police shop.
   You don't have to change that room, just edit
   "players/padrone/secret_police/location.h" and change SHOP_PLACE.

6. You will probably want to look in "players/padrone/walker/cell.c",
   and change the long description of the Chaosblade
   to reflect the location of the secret police shop.

7. If you want to use the deposit box service,
   then find a place to put it in.
   You don't have to change that room, just edit
   "/players/padrone/deposit/deposit.h" and change DEPOSIT_PLACE.
   Then you must edit my "castle.c", so it loads the facade.
   You must also move the files "/players/padrone/deposit/boxroom.c"
   AND "/players/padrone/deposit/boxroom.o" to the /room directory!
   It might be a good idea to make backups of "/room/boxroom.o" once
   every day or so, at least until you feel confident that it works.

8. If you want the weather, edit the castle.c to load it.

9. You might want to add more mirrors to the mirror-maze.
   Do this by editing "/players/padrone/maze/load_mirrors.c".

10. You might want to add some more places to put wanted posters in.
    Change "/players/padrone/inside/sheriffs_office.c".

11. You might want to change "/players/padrone/MESSAGE" to some
    appropriate message.
    If you change the MESSAGE message, DO NOT sign it "Padrone"!

12. In the LPmud game, and as wizard, type "load /players/padrone/castle".

13. Look at the errors in "/log/padrone" and "/lpmud.log".

14. Fix the errors.
    If those errors were caused by my code, mail me.

15. Now that you know that everything is working, add the line
	players/padrone/castle
    to the file "/room/init_file"!

16. Maybe you should put a prince called Violens somewhere in the game,
    so Sir Obliterator has someone to kill?
    In that case, you can install the padrones_obliterator quest too
    (look in castle.c).
