Killing the Chaosdemon -- an LPmud Adventure by Padrone
-------------------------------------------------------

	Kill the Chaosdemon!

	The well-known wizard Padrone, sometimes known as the Wizard of
	(hah!) Law and Balance, has captured a demon of chaos. In his usual
	megalomaniac stupidity he didn't kill it, but just put it in a
	cell in his (in)famous walking castle. There is even a rumour that
	he did this only to use the demon as a guard for his money!
	That demon is an abomination and a threat, and it must be killed!

This adventure is a bit hard. To solve it, you need to do several things:
	1. (This is not a necessary part, but it helps):
	   Go to the captain of the Secret Police, and volunteer for
	   the dangerous mission. He will give you some secret orders,
	   and those orders actually tell you how to solve this quest
	   (or rather, adventure).
	2. First you must break into the treasury in the (stationary!)
	   castle in the forest, and steal both the mighty sword Lawbringer
	   and the key to the demon's cell.
	3. Second, you must find the walking castle and kill the pirate king
	   to get the key to the walking castle's treasury.
	4. Then you must use the pirate king's key to open the door to
           the treasury, use the other key to open the next door into
	   the cell, and use Lawbringer to kill the chaosdemon.
	   To use Lawbringer, you must be of neutral alignment!
	5. Finally, bring the demon's sword (the Chaosblade) to the
	   captain of the Secret Police, and give it to him.
	   He will then give you a reward of 10000 gold coins.


1. Go to the captain of the Secret Police
-----------------------------------------

North from Ingis' Good Alley [players/ingis/good_alley] on Nannymud,
there is a shop. You cannot buy or sell anything there, since the shop is
only a cover run by the Secret Police.

Enter the shop [players/padrone/secret_police/shop],
and go north - north - north to the office of the captain.
If you are at least level 10, he will ask you to perform a special mission
(with some reluctance, if you are not level 15 or higher).

Answer yes to his question ("say yes", "say ok" or something similar),
look at your orders ("exa orders"),
and read them ("read orders").
The orders can only be read once, but they do contain a substantial
amount of useful information, as shown by this example:

> read orders
You read the secret orders.

    The wizard Padrone has captured a demon, called the Chaosdemon,
    and keeps it imprisoned in his walking castle.
    Your orders are to kill that demon, and to bring back its weapon,
    the Chaosblade, to your commanding officer, the Captain.
    You will be rewarded.

    Further instructions:
    1. You need a special weapon, called the Lawbringer, to kill the demon.
       It is known to have been stored in Padrone's treasury, and recent
       intelligence reports indicate that it can be found
         carried by A small thief
         inside Treasury Vault.
    2. To be able to enter the cell were the demon is kept,
       you need the panzer key that can be found in Padrone's treasury.
    3. According to secret information, the walking castle has been stolen
       by pirates, and was most recently seen in The shore of Crescent Lake.
    4. Do not (repeat: NOT) try to use the demon's weapon.

              Signed: Otto von Bruto, Chief of the Secret Police

> Suddenly, the secret orders catch flame and turn to ashes!
The captain says: The safety of the realm is threatened!


2. To get the Lawbringer
------------------------

If you go to the museum [players/padrone/inside/museum] just inside
the gates to my castle, you can find a small crystal ball. That ball
tells you were you can find the Lawbringer.

For example, if it is inside the treasury:
	> exa ball
	This is a small, softly glowing crystal ball.
	As you look into it you see:
	    The Lawbringer of Balance,
	    carried by A small thief,
	    inside Treasury Vault.
	It seems as if this crystal ball has been stored in the same room
	as the mighty sword Lawbringer so long that it has been attuned to it.

At any time there can only be ONE Lawbringer in the game, so if someone else
has already taken it you must get it from that player. The crystal ball will
always tell you where to find it!

To rob the treasury, first you need to get into the tower hall
[players/padrone/tower/hall], inside the locked tower.
There are three different ways to do that:
	a) Kill the Wizard's apprentice, take his key, open the tower door
	   and use the stairs.
	b) Kill the Wizard's apprentice, take his hat, and use it to teleport
	   straight into my workroom. Then just go downstairs to the tower hall.
	   Note: if you want to teleport, you need to know the magic words,
	   and those are on a note INSIDE the tower
	   [in players/padrone/tower/lab].
	c) Go through Uglagrok's mirrormaze. There is a magic mirror in the
	   lab [players/padrone/tower/lab]. From there, go west to the tower
	   hall.

When you are in the tower hall, try to enter my workroom (go upstairs from
the tower hall). This will sound an alarm, and a giant stainless steel dragon
with a machine gun will show up.
The dragon is big and dangerous (level 19, wc variable 2-40, 400 hp, ac 16,
spell damage 40 with 50% chance). It is not aggressive.
You must kill the dragon, because it has the key (A moderate-security key)
to the door to the treasury.

Then, inside the treasury, comes the next problem: the guards.
Guarding the treasury are Rambo I and Rambo II, armed with M-16s,
and Rambo III, armed with a machine gun.
Rambo I is level 15 (wc variable 1-20, 162 hp, ac 3).
Rambo II is level 16 (wc variable 1-20, 170 hp, ac 4).
Rambo III is level 17 (wc variable 2-40, 178 hp, ac 4).

All three Rambos must be killed.
Rambo III has the key (A maximum-security key) to the vault.

Finally, inside the vault, there are two thieves, a small thief and a big thief.
They have already taken all the things and are just about to leave, so you
have to kill them too. At least the small thief, who has the Lawbringer
and the key (A panzer key) to the cell in the vault in the walking castle.
Small thief is level 5 (wc 20, 50 hp, ac 15, spell damage 10 with 20% chance).
Big thief is level 16 (wc 20, 200 hp, ac 10, spell damage 30 with 20% chance).

3. To find the walking castle
-----------------------------

The castle, controlled by the pirates, is walking around in the world,
noone knows where - except that
	(a) it starts in /room/plane2,
	(b) it doesn't automatically walk out of the /room areas, and
	(c) it doesn't (shouldn't) go indoors.
When walking randomly, which the castle does as long as the pilot
on the bridge is alive, it takes a step to the north, south, east or west
every 15 seconds.

You have to find the castle.
[small note for wizards: the castle is NOT alive, so wizards can't do
"goto castle" to get to it - but "goto invisible castle mover" works!]
If you climb to the top of the watchtower in my castle in the forest
(the room is called "players/padrone/inside/tower_top"),
and look at the view, you will see where the castle is.

There is a magic mirror, connected to Uglagrok's mirrormaze, inside the
walking castle, so if you cannot find it by searching it is still possible
to go through the maze.

Inside the castle, you'll have to go to the bridge (upstairs, south
of the castle yard). There you will find the pirate king, two pirates,
and a pilot. You need to kill at least the pirate king, because he has
the key to the vault (the bullet-proof key). He keeps it in a bag.
The pirate king is level 12 (wc 10, 200 hp).


4. Killing the demon
--------------------

Go to the upper hall in the walking castle
[players/padrone/walker/upper_hall].
Unlock the door leading north with the key from the pirate king
(A bullet-proof key).

Go north through the door, to the vault [players/padrone/walker/vault].
Unlock the next door, also leading north, with the key from the
treasury in the stationary castle (A panzer key).
Go north through that door, into the cell with the Chaosdemon.

The demon is invulnerable, except to the sword Lawbringer, so you have
to wield that sword. To be able to use the Lawbringer, you must be
neutral (alignment -39..+39).
To change your alignment you can pay the apprentice in Padrone's
consultation room [players/padrone/inside/cons]. The fee is 100 gold
coins for each alignment point he changes, but, since Padrone uses the
Chaosdemon to store his money, all money you pay to the apprentice
can be retrieved once you have killed the demon!

Kill the demon with the Lawbringer.

A small note: The Chaosdemon changes its alignment every heartbeat,
so killing it could have an unpredictable effect on your own alignment
-- but it usually doesn't. In fact, most probably your alignment isn't
changed at all by killing the Chaosdemon.

Another note: The demon's sword, the Chaosblade, can not be wielded!
It will disappear if you try.


5. Giving the Chaosblade to the Secret Police captain
-----------------------------------------------------

This part is easy!

Note that it is not necessary for you to visist the captain before
you embark on the quest. The only thing you have to do is to go to
his office and give him the Chaosblade!
