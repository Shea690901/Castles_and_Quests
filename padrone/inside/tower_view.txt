    The forest stretches for miles in all directions,
    but beyond the forest, in the north, you see a large open plain.
    There are some mountains at the horizon.
    To the west you see a valley. From this distance, it looks nice.
    A few miles to the east you can make out some of the houses in a village.
    South you see only trees, but you think there is water beyond the trees.
