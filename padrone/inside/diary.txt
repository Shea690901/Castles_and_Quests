It seems to be some kind of diary, written a few weeks ago, and you read it
with great interest, even if the notes are few and short:

    Septober, 16:
        Arrived at the Castle, and went around here and there.
        Talked to the Wiz's Apprentice. Nice guy, and real good at magic!
    Septober, 17:
        After resting in the safety of the guestroom, I started exploring.
	The tower is a private area, but, well...  And I almost got killed
	there! Stupid guard! I got up, however, and found some interesting
	rooms. I tried to climb the ladder further up, but then this
	ENORMOUS DRAGON showed up and stopped me! But they say it's just
	the wizard's workroom up there.
    Septober, 18:
        Today I heard a rumor that the Wizard has some truly interesting
        things up in his treasury, in the tower. I sneaked up again to
	check it out, but the dragon was still there. But I found out that
	the dragon has the key, and that there are some really, and I mean
        REALLY, heavy guys guarding the treasury, waiting in there.
        But I'll try it anyway, tomorrow! I am good at fighting!

After that, there are no more notes in the diary...
