You read the big sign:

	Are you tired of all the typing? Are your fingers bleeding?
	There is a solution, and it has a name. It's name is PMF.

    PMF is an acronym for Padrone's MudFrontend (or maybe MudFilter).
    It is a frontend, also known as a client, for playing MUD.
    The PMF program connects to the MUD server in the same way as telnet, but
    some of the lines you type are interpreted as commands to the PMF program.

    If you are familiar with the Unix shell tcsh, you should feel vaguely at
    home in PMF: it has (at least almost) the same kind of aliases, history
    list and command-line editing that you know from tcsh.
    There is also a robot mode, and a sound mode for Sun SPARCstations.

    PMF runs on Unix systems.

	PMF version 1.12.1 is now available for anonymous ftp
	from Nanny. Read the small sign below this one!
