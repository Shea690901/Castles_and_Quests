    SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE CASTLE OF PADRONE:

    1. You must always carry your ticket with you while inside the
       castle. If you do not do this, the guards may kill you.
    2. The Wizard's consultation room is east of the main hall.
       Various magical assistance is provided for a small fee.
    3. The guest rooms are on the second floor. While you are inside
       one of these rooms, noone else can enter the room.
       There is also a conference room on the second floor.
    4. The bodyguards (west of the courtyard) are not very smart.
       They will follow you and obey orders, but don't expect them
       to understand everything. They will also randomly attack
       other monsters, unfortunately including other bodyguards.
