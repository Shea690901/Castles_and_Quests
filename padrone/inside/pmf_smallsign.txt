You read the small sign:

    If you have ftp access, you can get the source code for PMF
    from Lysator's ftp.lysator.liu.se (130.236.254.13). Just type
    	ftp ftp.lysator.liu.se
    or, if that doesn't work,
    	ftp 130.236.23.254
    When it asks for your name, login as "anonymous".
    PMF is in the file pmf-1.12.1.tar.Z in the directory pub/lpmud/clients.
    You can get it by typing
    	cd pub/lpmud/clients
    	binary
    	get pmf-1.12.1.tar.Z
    	get lpmud-sound.tar.Z	<-- If you want sounds on your SPARC.
    Now you must uncompress and unpack PMF:
    	uncompress pmf-1.12.1.tar.Z
    	tar xvf pmf-1.12.1.tar
    Then follow the instructions on "Installing and compiling" in pmf.doc!
