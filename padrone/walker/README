The Walking Castle - a moving castle for LPmud
----------------------------------------------

This is the new, perfect, bug-free version (version 4).
Author: Thomas Padron-McCarthy (Email: padrone@lysator.liu.se) 1990

Put the files in a LPmud directory called "/players/padrone/walker".
If you want to, you can edit the #defines in "walker.h".
If your LPmud spells "armour" as "armor", then you must
change the #define for ARMOUR in "walker.h".

Put a line in "/room/init_file", saying "players/padrone/walker/castle".

You can also read the comments at the head of "castle.c" and
in "walker.h" about how to install and use the walking castle.

Copyright: No. Do anything you want with it. 
           Except, don't sell it and don't claim you wrote it.

That means:
	This castle is distributed free of charge,
	and it can be used freely for fun and games.
	You may NOT, however, sell it or try to make money from
	it in any other way. For example, you are NOT allowed to use
	it on your LPmud if the players have to give you money to play.
	Don't claim you wrote it, not even if you make changes to the
	code, or if you use only parts of it, modified or unmodified.

Warranty:
	None whatsoever. What did you expect?
