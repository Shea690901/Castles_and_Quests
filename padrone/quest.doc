The WalkerQuest
---------------

	Padrone is sad. He built a beautiful walking castle,
	but a gang of pirates stole it and now he cannot
	find it any more. Help him to get it back!
	You don't have to be big and dangerous to solve this quest,
	but it's always a good idea to bring a weapon and some armour...

The objective is to find my walking castle, which was stolen by pirates,
and bring it back to me. Well, not to ME really, but to the Padrone-robot
[id: "golem" or "golem-padrone"] that I made for this purpose and that can
be found in the room "players/padrone/outside/finish_quest" ("Open place").
From /room/forest6 this room is south - south - south - east - east.

The castle, controlled by the pirates, is walking around in the world,
noone knows where - except that
	(a) it starts in /room/plane2,
	(b) it doesn't automatically walk out of the /room areas, and
	(c) it doesn't (shouldn't) go indoors.
When walking randomly, which the castle does as long as the pilot
on the bridge is alive, it takes a step to the north, south, east or west
every 15 seconds.

To solve the quest you have to find the castle.
[small note for wizards: the castle is NOT alive, so wizards can't do
"goto castle" to get to it - but "goto invisible castle mover" works!]

There is a magic mirror, connected to Uglagrok's mirrormaze, inside the
walking castle, so if you cannot find it by searching it is still possible
to go through the maze.

Inside the castle, you'll have to go to the bridge (upstairs, south
of the castle yard). There you will find the pirate king, two pirates,
and a pilot. These must be killed, and then you can use the "move joystick"
command to drive the castle to the place where my robot is. Leave the castle,
and when you arrive where the robot stands, the quest is solved!

The pilot is level 3 (wc 5), the two pirates are level 2 (wc 5)
and 4 (wc 5), and the pirate king is level 12 (wc 10, 200 hp).
This is the only fighting you have to do during the quest
(and you have to run past one additional pirate).

Hints are given to the players by Golem-padrone, who has some lines to say.
The drunk guard in "players/padrone/outside/north_shore" also talks a lot.
If you climb to the top of the small tower in my castle in the forest
("players/padrone/inside/tower_top") and "look at view",
you will see where the walking castle is!

If you park the castle in my front yard ("players/padrone/outside/front_yard"),
which many people do, and leave the castle, the guard (if he is there)
will tell you where to put it instead.

The main difficulty with this quest is probably that I have built a lot
of things that are completely unrelated to the quest, and if a player
starts exploring my castle it can of course take some time. But maybe
that is the idea?
