Hi there!

This is the export version of my castle, meaning that I don't really live
here, but I might show up now and then just for fun.

Unfortunately I am playing a game called Real Life a lot these days (even
if I'm trying to cut down on it), and I will not be able to visit here on
the Mud game as often as I would like to.

I hope you won't have any problems with bugs and such things in my castle
(this is the bug-free version!), but if you do, you probably don't want to
send mail to me on this Mud, since it could take a few years or so for me
to respond, if I ever do. Talk to the local wizards instead!

If you have a really urgent message, or just want to say hi,
try my real-life E-mail address, "padrone@lysator.liu.se"!
