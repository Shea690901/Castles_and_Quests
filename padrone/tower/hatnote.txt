  Dear Wizard, I have finally finished my research on the Wizard's Hat:

    1. It has its own internal power. When it is full, it has 100%.
       It periodically gets new power, but not if the light is on.
    2. The following magic words should be said to use the hat:
       a) "memorator situ" -- to set the teleport destination (takes 1% power)
       b) "hoppla jump" -- to teleport (takes between 10 and 20%)
       c) "lux" -- to turn on the light (10%)
       d) "finito lux" -- to turn off the light (takes no power)
       e) "vanish zap" -- to become invisible (only temporary, takes 20%)
       f) "solidus reflectus" -- to become visible again (2%)
       g) "ego reparator" -- heal self (40%, plus an additional 30% if frog)
       h) "pratus status" -- the hat will tell you how it feels (1%)
       i) "sobrus instamatic" -- remove intoxication (takes 30%)
       j) "glug glug" -- drink the power of the hat
