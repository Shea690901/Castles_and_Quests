It says:

    To the Master Treasurer.

    I have found the precautions taken to protect my treasury
    unsatisfactory. Those stupid guards attack everybody, even me,
    but that doesn't stop criminals from REPEATEDLY entering
    the vault and stealing the few items I have managed to collect
    over the years.
    Because of this, all money will instead be stored in the vault
    in my new, beautiful walking castle. I have parked it in a nice
    place out in the plains, and I believe my money will be safer
    there than here, especially as I have put a demon to guard it.

                         Padrone, W. of L. and B.

    PS. And by the way, find yourself a new job. /P
