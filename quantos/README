This castle was imported to NannyMud from Avalon the summer of 1990 (Avalon
was 20-Feb-91 at 128.46.153.43 port 2020). It was then heavily hacked by
Pell to conform to the latest (European) LPmud version (2.4.5), and to fix
a couple of bugs. Quantos was never able to complete (is there such a word?
(:-)) his castle since Avalon shut down. But I think what is here is very
good.

Bug complaints, fixes, etc, to pell@lysator.liu.se. Quantos Tanthalon
is naturally not responsible for any bugs I might have introduced.
I am grateful to him for being able to use his fine castle. Thanks!

And you who get this castle for free; don't stamp your name on it and pretend
you wrote it. This has already happened and it reflects very badly upon
yourself. Give credit where credit is due. Otherwise you are free to do
what you want with it, but please keep to the fine spirit.

Latest update: 19-Jul-91. /Pell
